# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project
Steve's parents thought it fate to go all in with Daqo New Energy when they noticed the stock's ticker, DQ, since they met at Dairy Queen. Steve is a recent finance graduate and wants to help his parents create a diversified portfolio with large trade volume and high return stocks. Since Steve's VBA skills still need some fine tuning, he contacted me to create a dynamic financial model that can capture stocks trade volumes and returns from changing data sets. The model must be able to draw insights from varying years and tickers.  

### Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to build a dynamic financial model that Steve could use to identify stocks with large trade volumes and high returns in order to build and manage his parent's portfolio on a yearly basis.
